This is my personal imgui starter template. It is public for anyone who wants to use it

It builds on linux, using the glfw3/opengl3 template that is provided by imgui

It has a bunch of boilerplate stripped out since I'm not building for macos or windows,
and the initial window just has the hello world widget. You can choose to use the 
makefile or the CMakeLists.txt. They both output to the bin directory.
